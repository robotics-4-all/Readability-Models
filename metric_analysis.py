for each commit

	for each metric:
		find out whether it:
		  - showed no significant change in all files
		  - increased or unchanged in all files (by how much?)
		  - decreased or unchanged in all files (how much?)
		  - increased in some files, decreased in others. (Can we determine which is greater? Increase or decrease? How to choose? Num of lines changed per file? Total SLOC per file? For now maybe just categorise in these 4, and don''t determine which is greater)




for each metric:
	
a) either:

	determine if it increases in most readability commits, or decreases, or is unchanged, or changes both ways
	(Then ask, is this expected?)
	
	determine the same for non-readability commits.
	(Then ask, is this expected?)

	Does it changes in the same way?
